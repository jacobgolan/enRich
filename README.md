enrichR is a simple R package designed to interface with the Local
Contexts Hub API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of enRich from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jacobgolan/enRich")
```

## Getting started

Install and load `enRich`

``` r
library(enRich)
```

`enRich` is a simple and easy to use package. Here is an index of its
key functions:

``` r
?index.all.projects() # create a table of all projects in the LC Hub

?find.project.id() #search for a project's unique ID

?find.projects() #find and retrieve projects' metadata, notices and TK/BC labels

?readFASTA() #import a FASTA file into R

?outputFASTA() #export a FASTA file from R

?testFASTA() #create a dummy FASTA for learning
```

# **Step 1**: Importing Sequences

The function `testFASTA()` allows us to create a dummy FASTA for
testing. You must specify the following arguments:

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
